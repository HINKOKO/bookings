# **GO - Booking project**

## **Description**

This project is a follow-along tutorial, created by Instructor **Trevor Sawler** for getting hands dirty on the Go programming language, used for backend purposes on this project<br>
We create a booking management system, with an admin panel too, for a fictionnal Bed & Breakfast we pretend to own<br>

<u>We cover the following:</u>

- How to render Templates in Go
